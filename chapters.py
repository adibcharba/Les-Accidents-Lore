During the project, Les Accidents' wild behavior continued, with a most controversial event happening in which Ali-Hassan requested to use Mathieu's bathroom. The events following this aren't clear, and experts are divided. Some claim that the projectile shitting and explosivity of Ali-Hassan's dump severely damaged the bathroom, while others claim that this is false, stating it is defamation.
